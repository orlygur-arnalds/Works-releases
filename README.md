In 2022 I made a piece for the danish ensamble K!ART performed in Mengi. The piece was an attempt to make a modular score. I made a lot of experiments on my guitar and a piano I had access to. I always like sounds where the production of it is not easilly recognized so with instrumental music I have often been quite frustrated by distinct instrumental sounds so I did my best to find sounds that sparked my interest. For this I tuned all the guitar strings so low that you can barely hear a stable pitch. Fron that I found a lot of textures that excited me. For the piano I just put Blu-Tack on all the strings to dampen the traditional overtones and tried to distribute it diagonally for variations. From these experiments I created soound blocks and notated it similar to some scores by LAchenmann. I left the speed of the blocks open as well as allowing the instrumentalists to start where ever in the block and read it forward and backwards. I also left it up to the players to go beetween the blocks freely. Ideally the players should study the blocks and remember them to go smoothly from one to the other.

Arto Lindsay – I Had A Fever When
In 2023 Arto Lindsey came to Iceland to play in Mengi for two gigs. I ended up doing sound on one of the gigs. For the trip he also wanted to make an album wich I help'd to record. I ended up also contrubuting electronics. The session also included good friends Skúli Sverrisson and John McCowen. The sessions were mostly recordings of each musician individually playing their instruments, and then he put the recordings together in a linear fashion. The album only had a vinyl physical release in Berlin so for a long time I had no idea how it sounded, it was really hard to imagine what the structure or soundscape would be. And by the time I got a copy I had already forgotten most of the sounds. I was really pleasently surprised with the outcome. The hard cutting beetween the sound scenes turned out to be really tasteful and the pairing of the sounds with spoken word and singing was really beautiful to hear, my fft max patch thing paird with the sound of Arto's voice was is something I could never imagine happening.
