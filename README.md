In 2022 I made a piece for the danish ensamble K!ART performed in Mengi. The piece was an attempt to make a modular score. I made a lot of experiments on my guitar and a piano I had access to. I always like sounds where the production of it is not easilly recognized so with instrumental music I have often been quite frustrated by distinct instrumental sounds so I did my best to find sounds that sparked my interest. For this I tuned all the guitar strings so low that you can barely hear a stable pitch. Fron that I found a lot of textures that excited me. For the piano I just put Blu-Tack on all the strings to dampen the traditional overtones and tried to distribute it diagonally for variations.
