In 2022 I made a piece for the danish ensamble K!ART performed in Mengi. The piece was an attempt to make a modular score. I made a lot of experiments on my guitar and a piano I had access to. I always like sounds where the production of it is not easilly recognized so with instrumental music I have often been quite frustrated by distinct instrumental sounds so I did my best to find sounds that sparked my interest. For this I tuned all the guitar strings so low that you can barely hear a stable pitch. Fron that I found a lot of textures that excited me. For the piano I just put Blu-Tack on all the strings to dampen the traditional overtones and tried to distribute it diagonally for variations. From these experiments I created soound blocks and notated it similar to some scores by LAchenmann. I left the speed of the blocks open as well as allowing the instrumentalists to start where ever in the block and read it forward and backwards. I also left it up to the players to go beetween the blocks freely. Ideally the players should study the blocks and remember them to go smoothly from one to the other.

Arto Lindsay – I Had A Fever When
<br>
In 2023 Arto Lindsey came to Iceland to play in Mengi for two gigs. I ended up doing sound on one of the gigs. For the trip he also wanted to make an album wich I help'd to record. I ended up also contrubuting electronics. The session also included good friends Skúli Sverrisson and John McCowen. The sessions were mostly recordings of each musician individually playing their instruments, and then he put the recordings together in a linear fashion. The album only had a vinyl physical release in Berlin so for a long time I had no idea how it sounded, it was really hard to imagine what the structure or soundscape would be. And by the time I got a copy I had already forgotten most of the sounds. I was really pleasently surprised with the outcome. The hard cutting beetween the sound scenes turned out to be really tasteful and the pairing of the sounds with spoken word and singing was really beautiful to hear, my fft max patch thing paird with the sound of Arto's voice was is something I could never imagine happening.

Ofcourse it was an absoloute honor to get to work with Arto, finding DNA as a teenager was a big turning point for me musically and conceptually. The way it breaks down and blurs the lines beetween the diferent elements of music (texture, rythm, melody) and creates a wholeistic block of musical affect. For me it gets to the absoloute essence of music and is something I am always drawn to.

Orgel verk
In 2024 I got asked to do a midi piece for the Hallgrímskirkja organ. I got to do a few experiments in the church and again I got really frustrated. it all for a lack of a better description sounded like an organ. I tried to get some inspiration from Ligeti's organ pieces but figured out a lot of the beautiful textures he achives stem from the fact that he had control of the wind pressure wich I had no control of. I made a few generators in Max focusing on the highest and lowest registers of the organ only using 2 stops, mostly stops that are closest to sine waves. The length of the notes were also most of the time not much longer then 20ms. I had one generate clouds of notes through a chaotic process and another generating clussters with semi stable rythm. I mostly emphaisez control on the density of the cluster, speed and how large the range of notes to pull from as well as where on the register. I also had control on the stops in and out messeage's so I could use these same processes on the stops wich created a faint mechanical wodden souns. With these rapid super short tones I managed to get to a point where I was fairly happy with the sound.

Upcoming album for slef-repair
For the last few years, whenever I’ve had the time and energy, I’ve been creating patches in Max. These often begin with musical ideas I encounter through friends or stumble upon by chance. They’ve ranged from an obsession with FFT and the idea of freezing sound, to generating FM matrices for harmonic material, and the beautiful textures of DJ scratching. 
The music that emerges from this work is almost an afterthought—secondary to the process of exploring these curiosities. When it comes time to compose a piece from these patches, I quickly lose interest. In that sense, these tracks are barely composed in the traditional way. Their structure arises entirely from their process of production. Their development in time a byproduct of how these sounds came into being.
